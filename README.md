# nnfs-with-python

Creating neural networks using Python, only using basic modules such as numpy. 

Following Harrison Kinsley & Daniel Kukie≈Ça's course, "Neural Networks from Scratch in Python".

## Why?

I am hugely interested in AI, and wanted to learn about neural networks. Although Python hosts frameworks (e.g. Pytorch/Tensorflow) which aim to make this process easier, I first wanted to gain a deep understanding of how these work "under the hood". This project has given me an amazing foundation to build upon as I move over to using a modern framework for future projects.
